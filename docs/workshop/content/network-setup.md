In this section we're going to be configuring the networking for our environment. 

With OpenShift virtualisation we have a few different options for networking - we can just have our virtual machines be attached to the same pod networks that our containers would have access to, or we can configure more real-world virtualisation networking constructs like bridged networking, SR/IOV, and so on. It's also absolutely possible to have a combination of these, e.g. both pod networking and a bridged interface directly attached to a VM at the same time, using Multus, the default networking CNI in OpenShift 4.x.

In this lab we're going to enable multiple options - pod networking and a secondary network interface provided by a bridge on the underlying worker nodes (hypervisors). Each of the worker nodes has been configured with an additional, currently unused, network interface. To utilise this we'll need a bridge device, `br1` to be created so we can attach our virtual machines to it. 

The first step is to use the new Kubernetes NetworkManager state configuration to setup the underlying hosts to our liking. Recall that we can get the **current** state by requesting the `NetworkNodeState`:

~~~bash
$ oc get nodes

In there you'll spot the interface that we'd like to use to create a bridge, `ens6`, ignore the IP address that it has right now, that just came from DHCP in our environment.

~~~bash
    - ipv4:
        address:
        - ip: 192.168.47.14
          prefix-length: 24
        auto-dns: true
        auto-gateway: true
        auto-routes: true
        dhcp: true
        enabled: true
      ipv6:

        - ip: fe80::6659:ee6e:7ecd:ca28

      mtu: 1500
      name: ens6
      state: up
      type: ethernet
~~~

Now let's create a policy to create a bridge on the nodes using this NIC. We want this to be on all workers, so we need to create a nodeSelector that ensure every worker is selected. We do that with `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""` This applies the config to all worker nodes.

~~~bash
$ cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: nmstate.io/v1alpha1
kind: NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy
metadata:
  name: br1-ens6-policy-workers
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    node-role.kubernetes.io/worker: ""
  desiredState:
    interfaces:
      - name: br1
        description: Linux bridge with ens6 as a port
        type: linux-bridge
        state: up
        ipv4:
          dhcp: true
          enabled: true
        bridge:
          options:
            stp:
              enabled: false
          port:
            - name: ens6
EOF

Then check as to whether it was successfully applied:

~~~bash
$ oc get nncp

$ oc get nnce

> **NOTE**: Only our workers will have matched the node selector, hence why only two of the above nodes show as "SuccessfullyConfigured".

We can also dive into the `NetworkNodeConfigurationPolicy` (**nncp**) a little further:

> **NOTE**: You might also like to try going onto each node with `oc debug node/node_name` and running an `ip a`. You'll find br1 holding the node's IP! 

Now that the "physical" networking is configured on the underlying worker nodes, we need to then define a `NetworkAttachmentDefinition` so that when we want to use this bridge, OpenShift and OpenShift virtualisation know how to attach into it. This associates the bridge we just defined with a logical name, known here as '**tuning-bridge-fixed**':

> **NOTE**: Since we named the bridge `br1` on both nodes in both our NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy's we don't need to create multiple versions of this `NetworkAttachmentDefinition`.

$ cat << EOF | oc apply -f -

> **NOTE**: The important flags to recognise here are the **type**, being **cnv-bridge** which is a specific implementation that links in-VM interfaces to a counterpart on the underlying host for full-passthrough of networking. Also note that there is no **ipam** listed - we don't want the CNI to manage the network address allocation for us - the network we want to attach to has DHCP enabled, and so let's not get involved.
