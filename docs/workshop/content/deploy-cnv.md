O**penShift Virtualization** is available as both upstream (**KubeVirt**) and downstream releases. As of this writing the downstream release is version 2.4 and is available from the OperatorHub. **This version is fully supported by Red Hat.** 

The mechanism for installation is to utilise the operator model and deploy via the OpenShift Operator Hub (Marketplace) in the web-console. It's entirely possible to deploy via the CLI should you wish to do so, but we're not documenting that mechanism here.

Use the **Console** portion of the lab for the next steps. As a reminder, the access is via the buttons at the top. Any CLI commands should be executed by clicking back to the **Terminal** via the same buttons.

<img  border="1" src="img/console-button.png"/>

Next, navigate to the top-level '**Operators**' menu entry, and select '**OperatorHub**'. This lists all of the available operators that you can install from the Red Hat Marketplace. Simply start typing '**virtualization**' in the search box and you should see an entry called "OpenShift Virtualization". 

<img  border="1" src="img/ocp-virt-operator-panel-2.png"/>

Select it and you'll see a window that looks like the following:

<img  border="1" src="img/ocp-virt-operator-install-2.png"/>

Click the 'Install' button. This takes you to a second window where you can set some details about the installation. Spend some time to review it, but you can leave the defaults as they'll automatically select the latest version of OpenShift Virtualization and will allow the software to be installed automatically:

<img  border="1" src="img/ocp-virt-operator-install-details.png"/>

Make sure that the namespace it will be installed to is "**openshift-cnv**" - it should be the default entry, but make sure. When you're ready, press the **'Install'** button. The install process progress will be displayed:

<img  border="1" src="img/ocp-virt-operatore-install-progress.png"/>

Wait for the install to complete successfully; it may take a few minutes:

<img  border="1" src="img/ocp-virt-operatore-install-success.png"/>

Next we need to deploy the rest of the OpenShift Virtualization components that this operator provides. Select the "**OpenShift Virtualization**" link under the '**Name**' column, and you'll be presented with the following:

<img  border="1" src="img/ocp-virt-hco-1.png"/>

From here, select '**Create Instance**' on the '**CNV Operator Deployment**' button. You'll be presented with the '**Create HyperConverged Cluster**' screen. This will deploy all of the necessary components that are required to support OpenShift Virtualization. Click the '**Create**' button.

<img  border="1" src="img/ocp-virt-hco-2.png"/>

The '**kubevirt-hyperconverged**' operator will begin to install.

<img  border="1" src="img/ocp-virt-hco-3.png"/>

You can follow the install by moving to the **Workloads** -> **Pods** menu on the left. Choose **Filter** and select **Pending** to watch the pods deploy.

<img src="img/ocp-virt-hco-4.png"/>

You can also watch this via the CLI:

~~~bash
$ watch -n2 'oc get pods -n openshift-cnv'
(...)
~~~

> **NOTE**: It may take a few minutes for the pods to start up. Press **Ctrl+C** to exit the watch command.

During this process you will see a lot of pods create and terminate, which will look something like the following depending on when you view it; it's always changing:

<img src="img/deploy-cnv-watch2.png"/>

This will continue for some time, depending on your environment. Please ensure it completes successfully.

You will know the process is complete when you can return to the terminal and see that the operator installation has been successful by running the following command:

~~~bash
$ oc get csv -n openshift-cnv
NAME                                      DISPLAY                    VERSION   REPLACES   PHASE
kubevirt-hyperconverged-operator.v2.4.0   OpenShift Virtualization   2.4.0                Succeeded
~~~

If you do not see `Succeeded` in the `PHASE` column then the deployment may still be progressing, or has failed. You will not be able to proceed until the installation has been successful. Once the `PHASE` changes to `Succeeded` you can validate that the required resources and the additional components have been deployed across the nodes. First let's check the pods deployed in the `openshift-cnv` namespace:

~~~bash
$ oc get pods -n openshift-cnv
NAME                                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

> **NOTE**: All pods shown from this command should be in the `Running` state. You will have many different types, the above snippet is just an example of the output at one point in time, you may have more or less at any one point. Below we discuss some of the pod types and what they do.


Together, all of these pods are responsible for various functions of running a virtual machine on-top of OpenShift/Kubernetes. See the table below that describes some of the various different pod types and their function:

| Pod Name                             | Pod Responsibilities |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| *[bridge-marker](https://github.com/kubevirt/bridge-marker)*                      | Marks network bridges as available node resources.|
| *[cdi-*](https://github.com/kubevirt/containerized-data-importer)*                              |  The Containerised Data Importer (CDI) is a Kubernetes extension to populate PVCs with VM disk images or other data.

There's also a few custom resources that get defined too, for example the `NodeNetworkState` (`nns` for short) definitions that can be used with the `nmstate-handler` pods to ensure that the NetworkManager state on each node is configured as required. This is used for easily defining interfaces/bridges on each of the machines allowing connectivity for both the physical machine itself and for providing network access for pods (and virtual machines) within OpenShift/Kubernetes:

~~~bash
$ oc get nns -A
NAME                                AGE
cluster-august-lhrd5-master-0       8m53s
cluster-august-lhrd5-master-1       9m3s
cluster-august-lhrd5-master-2       8m58s
cluster-august-lhrd5-worker-6w624   9m1s
cluster-august-lhrd5-worker-mh52l   8m53s
~~~

Dive a little deeper into the config on one of the workers:

~~~bash

Here you can see the current state of the node (some of the output has been cut), the interfaces attached, and their physical/logical addresses. In a later section we're going to be modifying the network node state by applying a new configuration to allow nodes to utilise another interface to provide pod networking via a **bridge**. We will do this via a `NodeNetworkConfigurationEnactment` or `nnce` in short:

~~~bash
$ oc get nnce -n openshift-cnv
No resources found in openshift-cnv namespace.
~~~

As we've not set any additional configuration at this stage, it's perfectly normal to have 'no resources found' in the output above. We are going to build this in a later lab!


### Viewing the OpenShift Virtualization Dashboard

When OpenShift Virtualization is deployed it adds additional components to OpenShift's web-console so you can interact with objects and custom resources defined by OpenShift Virtualization, including `VirtualMachine` types. If you select the `Console` button at the top of this pane you should see the web-console displayed. You can now navigate to "**Workloads**" --> "**Virtualization**" on the left-hand side panel and you should see the new component for OpenShift Virtualization. Of course there aren't any Virtual Machines running yet.

<img src="img/ocpvirt-dashboard.png"/>

**Please don't try and create any virtual machines just yet, we'll get to that shortly. We have to set up Storage and Networking first.**
